# iiSU Interpreted
A work-in-progress port of iiSU, UsagiShade's upcoming clean UI to [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/).

Includes the following color variations:
- Light
- Dark
- Blue
- Green
- Teal

As well as some additional metadata added to the gamelist for completion.

Thanks to the collaboration of [@anthonycaccese](https://github.com/anthonycaccese) and [@solojazz](https://github.com/solojazz), various aspect ratios are now compatible.
- 16:9
- 16:10
- 21:9
- 4:3
- 19.5:9
- 8:7

Through the 5 available variants (including a grid one), you can choose to hide the clock, the system view controller icons, or both, or keep the default view.

### **IMPORTANT**
For version 3.4.0 or newer, due to playtime tracking support. To avoid issues and ensure that this feature works correctly, please ensure that your ES-DE is up to date.
