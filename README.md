# iiSU Interpreted
A work-in-progress port of iiSU, UsagiShade's upcoming clean UI to [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/). Includes light, dark and blue variations, as well as some additional metadata added to the gamelist for completion.

Thanks to the collaboration of [@anthonycaccese](https://github.com/anthonycaccese), various aspect ratios are now compatible. 16:9, 16:10, 21:9, 4:3 and 19.5:9.

Through the 4 available variants, you can choose to hide the clock, the system view controller icons, or both, or keep the default view.
